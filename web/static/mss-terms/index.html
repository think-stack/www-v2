          <u>MANAGED SERVICES SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS</u>
        </h1>
        <p>
          THESE MANAGED SERVICES TERMS (“Managed Services Terms”) shall apply
          with respect to all “Managed Services” (as defined herein) provided by
          Horsetail to or on behalf of Client as stated on the Statement of
          Services as signed by and between the Parties (“SoS”), as the same may
          be modified from time to time by the Parties in writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Managed Services</u></strong
          >: During the Term, Horsetail will provide to Client all of the
          managed information technology related services (“Managed Services”)
          as listed on the Statement of Services attached to the Master Services
          Agreement between Horsetail and Client (“SoS”), as the same may be
          revised from time to time by the written agreement of the Parties, for
          the fees as set forth on the SoS (subject to annual rate changes as
          may be indicated in a written notice delivered to Client within sixty
          days prior to the effective date of the rate change). If Client
          requires additional computer or network support services which are
          outside the scope of the Managed Services as identified on the SoS,
          Horsetail will provide Client with a price quotation for such
          additional services. Horsetail will not be obligated to perform any
          such additional Managed Services unless Client agrees in writing to
          the scope/price quotation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Managed Services Term</u></strong
          >: Unless otherwise stated herein or in the SoS, the term for the
          Managed Services (“Managed Services Term”) shall commence upon the
          execution of the SoS and be for an initial term of one (1) year,
          whereupon these Managed Services Terms shall automatically renew every
          year unless within thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the
          then current term, either Party provides written notice to the other
          Party that it does not intend to renew the Managed Services Term.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Managed Services Fees and Payment</u></strong
          >: During the Managed Services Term, Client shall pay Horsetail
          monthly in advance, the managed services fee(s) as stated on the SOS
          (whether singular or plural, the “Managed Services Fees”), on or
          before the first day of each month for the Managed Services. Client
          may pay the monthly Managed Services Fees by check or credit card
          (Visa, MasterCard, or American Express). Late payments shall incur
          interest at the maximum legal rate, or at the rate of 1.5% per month
          if there is no maximum legal rate. Horsetail may collect attorney’s
          fees equal to fifteen percent (15%) of any balance due if Client’s
          account is turned over to an attorney for collection, whether or not
          suit is filed. Managed Service Fees are based on Client’s employee
          count and such fees shall be modified as Client’s employee count
          changes. Client’s employee count will be audited quarterly. Client
          must produce its federal 941 tax statements or other acceptable
          quarterly employee list so that Horsetail can perform its audit of
          Client’s current employee count. Fees for Managed Services will be
          adjusted at time of audit to compensate for any change. Horsetail will
          charge Client for requested Managed Services in accordance with the
          following Rate Schedule:

          <strong><u>Expenses</u></strong
          >: Horsetail shall receive Client’s written authorization prior to
          incurring any expenses related to the purchase of equipment, software
          or hardware upgrades, replacements or enhancements, materials,
          airfare, lodging, food or other long-distance travel expenses. Where
          possible, all Expenses will be charged directly to the Client. The
          Retainer Fees shall be exclusive of disbursements and expenses, which
          shall include following specific items and any additional items
          approved in writing by Client (“Expenses”), which shall be charged and
          invoiced at cost together with a 10% handling charge: travel (and
          related lodging and food charges), courier and postage charges. If
          Client requests Horsetail to purchase goods or commission services
          from a third party where the cost is likely to be substantial,
          Horsetail will be entitled to require that all or some of that third
          party expense is paid in advance by Client before confirming the
          purchase or commission. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
          Agreement: (1) Client may not incur more than $10,000 in Expenses
          hereunder in any calendar month during the Retainer Services Term
          without obtaining the prior written consent of Client; (2) invoices
          for any Expenses shall be accompanied by itemized statements showing
          each Expense incurred hereunder and supported by bona fide receipts
          for each such Expense; and (3) Horsetail shall comply with any written
          travel and expense reimbursement guidelines and procedures provided to
          it by Client, to the extent they do not expressly violate any
          provision hereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Standard Business Hours</u></strong
          >: Horsetail’s standard hours for Managed Services are Monday through
          Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Eastern) (except Federal holidays). If
          Horsetail performs any Managed Services for Client at other times
          (such as nights or weekends) that are outside the scope of SOS, Client
          will be billed at a one (1) hour minimum at the rate of $200 per hour.
          If Horsetail performs Services for Client on Federal holidays, Client
          shall pay to Horsetail $200 per hour for the same. Although it will
          make every effort to do so if needed by the Client, Horsetail cannot
          guarantee that it will be available to perform Managed Services on
          nights, weekends or holidays.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Confidentiality</u></strong
          >: Horsetail agrees to hold all information pertaining to the Client’s
          business of a sensitive or financial nature in confidence, exercising
          reasonable care, and not to use such information for any purpose other
          than as needed to perform the Managed Services. Client shall inform
          Horsetail of any special confidentiality requirements which must be
          maintained with regard to its information (such as HIPAA, Consumer
          Credit Reporting, etc.) and of any special procedures that must be
          followed with regard to such information. Client agrees to indemnify
          and to hold Horsetail harmless from any and all damages, costs and
          expenses, including court costs, discovery costs and reasonable
          attorneys’ fees, if a claim is made against Horsetail for violating
          any confidentiality rules, regulations or laws which Client failed to
          disclose to Horsetail as being applicable to its information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Software Licensing</u></strong
          >: Horsetail does not support unlicensed software. Client represents
          that all installed software is licensed. If Client has any unlicensed
          software in the operation of its business, Client shall notify
          Horsetail in writing so that a remediation SoS, if possible, may be
          recommended by Horsetail to assist Client in achieving license
          compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Compliance With Laws</u></strong
          >: Each Party shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, County
          and local laws, ordinances, regulations and codes, including
          procurement of required permits or certificates, in Horsetail’s
          performance of these Managed Services Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Force Majeure</u></strong
          >: If performance of this Agreement, or any obligation hereunder is
          prevented, restricted or interfered with by any actor or condition
          whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of Horsetail, then upon
          giving prompt notice to Client, Horsetail will be excused from such
          performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or
          interference.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Unauthorized Work</u></strong
          >: During the Term, Horsetail shall have the EXCLUSIVE right to

          software and hardware that are supported by Horsetail, and Client
          shall not use or retain any other person or entity to perform such
          services on said items during the Managed Services Term. Any
          maintenance or support Services performed during the Managed Services
          Term on Client’s computer systems without the express written approval
          of Horsetail is prohibited and shall constitute a breach hereunder.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Termination</u></strong
          >: The Managed Services may be terminated for any of the following
          reasons: (a) by either Party providing the other Party with written
          notice of its intention to terminate the Managed Services Term by
          providing no less than thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of the
          next month, subject, however, if Client terminates these Managed
          Services Terms before the expiration of the Managed Services Term,
          Client shall remain liable to Horsetail for all obligations hereunder
          for the balance of the Managed Services Term and the terms hereof
          shall survive such termination; (b) by Horsetail if Horsetail does not
