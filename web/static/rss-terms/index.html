          <u>HORSETAIL TECHNOLGIES RETAINER SERVICES SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS</u>
        </h1>
        <p>
          THESE RETAINER SERVICES TERMS (“Retainer Services Terms”) shall apply
          with respect to all “Retainer Services” (as defined herein) provided
          by Horsetail to or on behalf of Client as stated on the Statement of
          Services as signed by and between the Parties (“SoS”), as the same may
          be modified from time to time by the Parties in writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Retainer Services</u></strong
          >. During the “Retainer Services Term” as stated herein, Horsetail
          shall be available to provide to or on behalf of Client certain
          information technology related services for the blocks of time, levels
          of experience and at the rate(s) as set forth on the SoS
          (collectively, the “Retainer Services”). Horsetail has agreed to
          provide the Retainer Services based on the specific information
          provided to it by Client. Should the information provided to Horsetail
          by Client prove to be inaccurate or misleading in any way or should
          the Parties desire to change the scope of the Retainer Services, the
          Parties shall attempt in good faith and with due diligence to revise
          on an equitable basis the fees and other terms for the applicable
          Retainer Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Fees</u></strong
          >. Client shall pay Horsetail for the Retainer Services the fixed
          monthly fee(s) for the same as stated on the SoS (whether singular or
          plural, the “Retainer Fees”), subject to adjustment as set forth in
          these Retainer Services Terms. Client shall pay Horsetail its first
          monthly Retainer Fees upon its execution and delivery of the SoS and
          before Horsetail begins to provide any Retainer Services. In addition,
          Client shall pay Horsetail for any additional Retainer Services
          undertaken outside the SoS, the fee for such additional work to be
          agreed upon and approved in writing by Client prior to the undertaking
          of such additional work from time to time, and for any reasonable
          Expenses (as defined below) incurred. Horsetail shall invoice Client
          for all Retainer Services one month in advance at the beginning of
          each month. For example, if Retainer Services are to commence on May
          1st, Horsetail shall bill Client upon signing the SoS for the first
          month of Retainer Services to be provided and its shall also invoice
          Client on May 1st for the Services to be rendered during June. Client
          must pay each invoice within 30 days after the invoice date. Any
          overpayments will be applied to the next billing cycle. Reserved but
          unused hours in any month will NOT be rolled over into future billing
          cycles, except in the event that Horsetail is unable to deliver its
          reserved hours to Client in accordance with these Retainer Services
          Terms and the SoS. IF FOR ANY REASON (OTHER THAN FOR HORSETAIL’S
          BREACH HEREOF), CLIENT TERMINATES THE RETAINER SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED
          HEREUNDER, CLIENT SHALL PROMPTLY BE INVOICED FOR AND PAY FOR ALL
          RETAINER SERVICES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE BILLED DURING THE BALANCE OF
          THE APPLICABLE RETAINER SERVICES TERM . Client’s obligation to pay the
          Retainer Fees is in no way conditional upon any specific objectives
          being achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Expenses</u></strong
          >. Where possible, all Expenses will be charged directly to the
          Client. The Retainer Fees shall be exclusive of disbursements and
          expenses, which shall include following specific items and any
          additional items approved in writing by Client (“Expenses”), which
          shall be charged and invoiced at cost together with a 10% handling
          charge: travel (and related lodging and food charges), courier and
          postage charges. If the Client requests Horsetail to purchase goods or
          commission services from a third party where the cost is likely to be
          substantial, Horsetail will be entitled to require that all or some of
          that third party expense is paid in advance by Client before
          confirming the purchase or commission. Notwithstanding any other
          provisions of this Agreement: (1) Client may not incur more than
          $10,000 in Expenses hereunder in any calendar month during the
          Retainer Services Term without obtaining the prior written consent of
          Client; (2) invoices for any Expenses shall be accompanied by itemized
          statements showing each Expense incurred hereunder and supported by
          bona fide receipts for each such Expense; and (3) Horsetail shall
          comply with any written travel and expense reimbursement guidelines
          and procedures provided to it by Client, to the extent they do not
          expressly violate any provision hereof.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Invoices</u></strong
          >. The Retainer Fees, all Expenses and all other sums payable under
          these Retainer Services Terms and the SoS are exclusive of any
          applicable sales tax, which shall be payable at the prevailing rate.
          Where any sum payable by the Client under these Retainer Services
          Terms is to be paid by the Client in a currency other than US Dollars,
          the sum in question will be converted into the currency of payment by
          reference to the relevant exchange rate as set out in the Wall Street
          Journal on the last day of the month in question. Horsetail will
          deliver to Client one single retainer invoice for the Retainer Fees,
          dated on or before the fifteenth day of the calendar month relating to
          the Retainer Services to be provided in the following calendar month.
          Payment must be received not later than the first day of the calendar
          month in which the applicable Retainer Services shall be provided.
          Horsetail will deliver an invoice separate from the Retainer Fees
          invoice for any Expenses incurred. Expenses will be invoiced in
          arrears. Payment must be received not later than 30 days after the
          date on which Client receives each invoice with supporting
          documentation. Without prejudice to Horsetail’s other rights and
          remedies, interest at the rate of 1.5% per month may be charged on any
          overdue invoice amount from the due date until the date payment is
          received. Client may pay the amounts due hereunder by check or credit
          card (Visa, MasterCard, or American Express). Late payments shall
          incur interest at the maximum legal rate, or at the rate of 1.5% per
          month if there is no maximum legal rate. Horsetail may collect
          attorney’s fees equal to fifteen percent (15%) of any balance due if
          Client’s account is turned over to an attorney for collection, whether
          or not suit is filed. If at any time payment on any outstanding
          invoices has not been received by Horsetail by the due date as
          outlined above, Horsetail will send notification of overdue invoices
          to Client. If Horsetail has not received payment within 5 days after
          the notification date, Horsetail may cease to provide any and all
          Retainer Services and/or any other work on Client’s account
          immediately. The work stoppage will continue until all past due
          invoices have been paid, along with payment of the next month’s
          Retainer Fees. If the work stoppage continues for more than 5 business
          days, all Horsetail staff committed to Client’s accounts may be
          reassigned as necessary to other Horsetail client accounts. If
          Horsetail personnel is reassigned due to nonpayment of Client
          invoices, and work subsequently resumes on Client’s account, it is
          likely that some of the Horsetail account team may not be immediately
          available to resume the contracted services. In this case, Horsetail
          reserves the right to meet with Client to develop a revised schedule
          for completion of contracted services, including the creation of a new
          account team.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Retainer Services Term and Termination</u></strong
          >. Except as otherwise noted herein, these Retainer Services Terms
          shall take effect as of the date stated on the SoS and shall continue
          until either Party terminates the Retainer Services by giving three
          months’ notice in writing to the other Party (such period, the
          “Retainer Services Term”). Either Party may at any time terminate the
          Retainer Services (without limiting any other remedy) with immediate
          effect by giving written notice of its election to do so to the other
          Party, should the other Party: (i) have an Administrator or Receiver
          appointed over the whole or any part of its assets or any order made
          or resolution passed for its administration or winding up (unless as
          part of a reconstruction or amalgamation) or compounds with or
          convenes a meeting of its creditors or suffers anything analogous to
          any of the foregoing under the law of any jurisdiction; or (ii)
          materially breach any provision of this Agreement and fail to remedy
          such breach within 30 days after receipt of notice detailing the
          breach. On termination for whatever reason, Client will be responsible
          for all Retainer Fees payable to Horsetail and all Expenses incurred
          by Horsetail on behalf of the Client up to the date the termination
          takes effect. On the satisfaction by the Client in full of its payment
          obligations, Horsetail will give the Client all reasonable
          co-operation and assistance to enable Client to take over any
          contracts and arrangements with third parties upon Horsetail being
          duly released from any obligations thereunder; and will transfer to
          Client all originals and copies of all documents and other items
          provided to Horsetail by Client pursuant to the Retainer Services and
          any unused materials purchased on behalf of the Client. If Client
          wishes to use any of the work prepared by Horsetail for the Client
          pursuant to the Retainer Services, such usage shall be dependent on
          the payment of an additional fee, the amount of which to be agreed by
          the Parties in advance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Specific Obligations</u></strong
          >. Client shall: (a) provide at its own expense to Horsetail such
          information, materials, equipment, machinery and assistance as
          Horsetail shall reasonably require to provide the Services; (b) ensure
          that any facts or opinions or other material it provides to Horsetail
          which will be the basis of any representation or statement to be
          contained in any material will be accurate and not misleading in any
          way and (where appropriate) will be authorized to be available for
          public use; (c) be responsible for the soundness of any material,
          equipment and machinery it supplies and the insurance of any equipment
          provided to Horsetail. Horsetail shall: (a) provide all Retainer
          Services hereunder in a good and workmanlike manner, in good faith and
          with due diligence; and (b) ensure that any work product it delivers
          hereunder does not violate the intellectual property rights of any
          third party.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>GLB Compliance</u></strong
          >. If Client is a “Financial Institutions” as defined under the
          Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6801 et seq. (“GLB”) and is
          subject to its implementing regulations published at 16 CFR Parts 313
          and 314 ("Privacy Laws"), or if it or any government authority
          subsequently determines that Client will act or is required to act as
          a financial institution for purposes of complying with GLB, Horsetail
          shall cooperate with Client as needed to ensure such compliance. To
          the extent the Retainer Services involve the use of non-public
          personal consumer information as protected by the privacy provisions
          of the Privacy Laws ("NPI"), Horsetail agrees that: (i) it does comply
          and shall continue to comply with the Privacy Laws applicable to it,
          (ii) it uses commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard, maintain
          and dispose of confidential NPI made available to or obtained by
          Horsetail from Client; and (iii) it will not disclose or use any such
          NPI except to carry out the purposes for which such information is
          provided to Horsetail.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Confidentiality</u></strong
          >: Horsetail agrees to hold all information pertaining to the Client’s
          business of a sensitive or financial nature in confidence, exercising
          reasonable care, and not to use such information for any purpose other
          than as needed to perform the Retainer Services. Client shall inform
          Horsetail of any special confidentiality requirements which must be
          maintained with regard to its information (such as HIPAA, Consumer
          Credit Reporting, etc.) and of any special procedures that must be
          followed with regard to such information. Client agrees to indemnify
          and to hold Horsetail harmless from any and all damages, costs and
          expenses, including court costs, discovery costs and reasonable
          attorneys’ fees, if a claim is made against Horsetail for violating
          any confidentiality rules, regulations or laws which Client failed to
          disclose to Horsetail as being applicable to its information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Software Licensing</u></strong
          >: Horsetail does not support unlicensed software. Client represents
          that all installed software is licensed. If Client has any unlicensed
          software in the operation of its business, Client shall notify
          Horsetail in writing so that a remediation SoS, if possible, may be
          recommended by Horsetail to assist Client in achieving license
          compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Compliance With Laws</u></strong
          >: Each Party shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, County
          and local laws, ordinances, regulations and codes, including
          procurement of required permits or certificates, in Horsetail’s
          performance of these Retainer Services Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Force Majeure</u></strong
          >: If performance of these Retainer Services Terms, or any obligation
          hereunder is prevented, restricted or interfered with by any actor or
          condition whatsoever beyond the reasonable control of Horsetail, then
          upon giving prompt notice to Client, Horsetail will be excused from
          such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction or
          interference.
